## Introduction 

The [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) is an optical sensor onboard two satellites named Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) operated by NASA. Terra was launched on 18 December 1999 and Aqua was launched on 24 May 2002. Terra's orbit around the Earth is such that it passes from North to South across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes South to North over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS take images for the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days. The data collected is the intensity of the light reflected by earth in 36 different wavelengths ("colors"). Both Terra and Aqua also have other sensors besides MODIS. These two sensors have publicly available daily archive of conditions on the earth surface for the past 20 years!

dm <- data.frame(m, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(dm) <- c("Spectral band number", "Intended use", "Spatial resolution")
knitr::kable(dm, caption="MODIS spectral bands and their spatial resolution")
```


## Processing levels

MODIS data is available at different levels of processing. 

- Level 0: Unprocessed raw satellite feeds ("ungridded orbital swath data").
- Level 1A: Raw un-calibrated swath data with georeference information.
- Level 1B: radiometrically calibrated with georeference information.
- Level 2: level 1 data atmospherically corrected to yield surface reflectance. 
- Level 2G: Levcel 2 data calibrated and stored as integers on the sinusoidal tiled gridded system. 
- Level 3: level 2 data, properly georeferenced, and often temporally composited or averaged. "Best" pixel selection (e.g. one value per pixel over a period of 7 days) 
- Level 4: data products that have been put through additional processing. Higher processing level than level 3.

More information of these products can be obtain from [MODIS Nomenclature](https://modaps.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/services/about/nomenclature.html).

## Products

The higher level data products can be grouped based on their application areas (see: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/). These products are usually distributed in different spatial resolution (250/500/1000 m) and temporal composite (daily/8-day/16-day/monthly/annual) combinations for both sensors.

Each of those products has a prefix for instance, "MOD" are products from the Terra satellite while "MYD" are products from the Aqua satellite and prefix "MCD" are products generated from a combination of the two satellites.

## File format

MODIS data is stored in "Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observation System" (HDF-EOS) files. HDF format was developed to support storing multiobject data sets (subdatasets) within one file (container). These subdatasets can include raster images, tables, scientific data sets (multidimensional arrays), annotations, vector files, palette information and many more formats.

Read more about use of HDF in NASA Earth Observation System data in [HDF-EOS Information Center](http://hdfeos.org/).

Converting HDF files to a common format (e.g. GeoTiff) that can be read across different software libraries has been one of the major challenges with MODIS data processing. Until recently, commercial programs like ArcGIS, ENVI were not able to read and explore HDF files. In the next section we will show how you can use R to search, download and process MODIS data..

## Geographic information

Each file stores data for an area of 10 by 10 degrees, using the sinusoidal coordinate reference system. 

## Tiling Scheme

The tiles are identified using rows "h" (for horizontal) and columns "v" (for vertical). MODIS uses a vertical horizontal tiling systems (e.g.tile h09v04 as shown in the figure below. A kmz file with MODIS Tile boundaries can be found [here](http://spatial-analyst.net/KML/MODIS_tiles.kmz)

## MOD09A1 product

Now let's look at an example MODIS surface reflectance product. "MOD09A1" is a surface reflectance product from data acquired by the MODIS sensor onboard the Terra satellite --- hence the prefix "MOD". It provides estimated "target at surface" spectral reflectance values that have been calibrated for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Global surface reflectance products can be obtained at either 250 m or 500 m spatial resolution, and as as daily or 8-day composite data. Below we show a table of the characteristics of the 13 layers that come with "MOD09A1". A more in-depth description is available [here](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod09a1v006/).
